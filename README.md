## Description

![Screenshot about map](public/screenshot_2.png)
This project is a web application that integrates CesiumJS, a 3D globe and map rendering engine, with React, a popular front-end JavaScript library, using Vite as the build tool. The project is written in TypeScript, a typed superset of JavaScript, for improved developer experience and code maintainability.

## Usage
Once you have the project running, you can interact with the 3D globe and map by using the user interface provided by the React components. The CesiumJS engine is integrated with React using the react-cesium package, which provides a set of pre-built CesiumJS components that can be easily used in a React application.
